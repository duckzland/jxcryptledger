# JXCryptLedger

A lightweight, local‑first crypto transaction ledger built with Flutter and Hive.  
It tracks balances, trades, and transaction trees.

## Features
- Your data stays on your device — everything is stored privately and securely.
- Track all your crypto activity in one place — buys, sells, transfers, and running balances.
- Switch between simple balance view and detailed trading view depending on what you need.
- Quickly find any coin with fast, offline search.
- Clean, easy-to-use interface designed to keep things clear and organized.

## Getting Started
1. Install Flutter (stable channel)
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Launch the app with `flutter run`

## Roadmap
- Export and import your data so you can back up your ledger or move it to another device.
- Stronger accuracy checks for transactions to make sure every calculation and update behaves exactly as expected.
- A smarter test database that can generate complex example data for easier testing and development.
- Reverse‑rate mode in Active Trading view so you can flip between price directions instantly while trading.
